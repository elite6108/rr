export const SECTION2_4_SUPERVISORS_TEMPLATE = '<div class="con"><p style="text-align: justify;">Supervisors and foremen occupy a critical position in the construction industry\'s health and safety management structure, serving as the vital link between senior management and the operational workforce. Under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, supervisors have specific duties to ensure the health and safety of all personnel under their direct supervision, including employees, subcontractors, apprentices, and any other persons who may be affected by the work activities. This responsibility extends to ensuring that all work is carried out in accordance with established safe systems of work, risk assessments, and method statements, whilst maintaining the highest standards of health and safety performance on construction sites.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 place specific duties on supervisors to ensure that construction work is properly planned, managed and monitored at the operational level. Supervisors must ensure that all personnel under their supervision are competent to carry out their assigned tasks safely, have received appropriate training and instruction, and understand the specific hazards and control measures associated with their work. This includes ensuring that site-specific induction training is provided to all new personnel before they commence work, that method statements and risk assessments are properly communicated and understood, and that safe systems of work are consistently implemented and maintained throughout the construction process.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Risk assessment and hazard identification represent fundamental aspects of supervisory responsibilities, requiring supervisors to conduct regular inspections of work areas to identify potential hazards and ensure that appropriate control measures are in place and functioning effectively. Under the Work at Height Regulations 2005, supervisors must ensure that work at height is properly planned, appropriately supervised, and carried out by competent personnel using suitable access equipment. This includes ensuring that fall protection measures are in place, that working platforms are properly constructed and maintained, and that rescue procedures are established where personnel may become stranded or injured whilst working at height.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The supervision of construction plant and equipment falls within the remit of site supervisors, who must ensure compliance with the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 and the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998. Supervisors must ensure that all plant and equipment is operated only by competent, authorised personnel, that pre-use inspections are carried out, and that any defects or safety concerns are immediately reported and addressed. This includes ensuring that lifting operations are properly planned and supervised, that appropriate exclusion zones are established and maintained, and that communication systems are in place to coordinate lifting activities safely.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Emergency response and incident management responsibilities require supervisors to be prepared to respond effectively to a wide range of construction-related emergencies, including accidents involving working at height, structural collapses, plant and equipment incidents, and medical emergencies. Supervisors must ensure that all personnel under their supervision understand the emergency procedures applicable to their work area, that emergency equipment is readily available and properly maintained, and that they are competent to coordinate initial emergency response activities pending the arrival of specialist rescue services. Under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (RIDDOR), supervisors must ensure that all accidents and incidents are properly investigated, documented and reported through the appropriate channels, and that immediate actions are taken to prevent recurrence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The maintenance of welfare facilities and site housekeeping standards represents an important aspect of supervisory responsibilities, requiring supervisors to ensure that adequate welfare facilities are provided and maintained in accordance with the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015. This includes ensuring that toilet facilities, washing facilities, rest areas, and facilities for changing and drying clothes are kept clean and in good working order, and that adequate first aid arrangements are in place and maintained. Supervisors must also ensure that construction sites are kept tidy and well-organised, that materials and equipment are properly stored, and that access routes and working areas are kept clear of obstructions and hazards. The enforcement of disciplinary standards forms a crucial part of supervisory responsibilities, requiring supervisors to address unsafe behaviours promptly and effectively, whilst providing positive leadership and setting high standards of health and safety performance for their teams.</p></div>';
