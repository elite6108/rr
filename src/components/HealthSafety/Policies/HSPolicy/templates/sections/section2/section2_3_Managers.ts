Under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, managers have both legal and moral duties to ensure the health, safety and welfare of all persons under their supervision, including employees, subcontractors, and members of the public who may be affected by construction activities. This responsibility extends to ensuring that all personnel possess the necessary competence, training and resources to carry out their duties safely and effectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 place specific duties on managers to ensure that construction projects are properly planned, managed and monitored throughout their duration. Managers must ensure that adequate arrangements are in place for the coordination of health and safety measures during both the pre-construction phase and the construction phase of projects. This includes ensuring that construction phase plans are developed, implemented and regularly reviewed, that suitable welfare facilities are provided in accordance with Schedule 2 of the CDM Regulations, and that all workers receive appropriate site-specific induction training before commencing work.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Risk management responsibilities require managers to ensure that comprehensive risk assessments are carried out for all construction activities under their control, addressing the specific hazards associated with construction work including working at height, excavation work, use of construction plant and equipment, manual handling operations, and exposure to hazardous substances. Under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002, managers must ensure that COSHH assessments are carried out where hazardous substances are used, that appropriate control measures are implemented, and that health surveillance is provided where required. They must also ensure compliance with the Work at Height Regulations 2005, implementing measures to prevent falls from height and ensuring that appropriate access equipment is provided and properly maintained.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 and the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 place specific duties on managers to ensure that all construction plant and equipment is suitable for the purpose for which it is used, properly maintained, and operated only by competent personnel. This includes ensuring that thorough examinations and inspections are carried out in accordance with regulatory requirements, that defects are promptly identified and rectified, and that comprehensive records are maintained. Managers must also ensure compliance with the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 2022, providing suitable PPE where risks cannot be eliminated or adequately controlled by other means.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Emergency preparedness and incident management form crucial aspects of managerial responsibilities in construction environments. Managers must ensure that comprehensive emergency procedures are in place for all construction activities, including arrangements for evacuation, rescue from height, confined space rescue, and response to structural collapses or other construction-related emergencies. Under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (RIDDOR), managers must ensure that all reportable incidents are properly investigated, documented and reported to the Health and Safety Executive within the required timescales. They must also ensure that lessons learned from incidents and near misses are effectively communicated throughout their teams and that appropriate corrective actions are implemented.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Subcontractor management and coordination represents a critical area of responsibility for construction managers, requiring them to ensure that all subcontractors demonstrate competence in health and safety management before being engaged. Under the CDM Regulations 2015, managers must ensure that subcontractors provide method statements and risk assessments for their work, that their activities are properly coordinated with other contractors, and that they comply with the site-specific health and safety requirements. This includes ensuring that subcontractors provide appropriate insurance coverage, that their personnel receive site induction training, and that their work is regularly monitored to ensure compliance with health and safety standards. Managers must also ensure effective communication and cooperation between different contractors working on the same site, preventing conflicts and ensuring that the activities of one contractor do not create additional risks for others.</p></div>';
