export const SECTION2_6_SUBCONTRACTORS_TEMPLATE = '<div class="con"><p style="text-align: justify;">Subcontractors operating within the construction industry bear significant legal and contractual responsibilities for health and safety management under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, and the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015. As independent contractors, they must demonstrate competence in health and safety management, maintain their own comprehensive health and safety policies and procedures, and ensure that these are effectively implemented throughout their operations. Subcontractors must also ensure that they possess adequate insurance coverage, including employer\'s liability insurance and public liability insurance, to protect against potential claims arising from their construction activities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015, subcontractors have specific duties to plan, manage and monitor their work to ensure that it is carried out without risks to health and safety. This includes ensuring that suitable and sufficient risk assessments are carried out for all aspects of their work, that appropriate method statements are developed and implemented, and that these documents are regularly reviewed and updated as circumstances change. Subcontractors must also ensure that they cooperate and coordinate with the principal contractor and other contractors to ensure that their work does not create additional risks for others, and that they comply with any site-specific health and safety requirements and procedures.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The demonstration of competence represents a fundamental requirement for subcontractors, encompassing both organisational competence and the individual competence of their workforce. Subcontractors must be able to demonstrate that they have the knowledge, experience, and resources necessary to carry out their work safely, and that all personnel engaged in construction activities possess the appropriate skills, training, and qualifications for their roles. This includes ensuring that operatives hold relevant Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) cards or equivalent qualifications, that plant operators possess appropriate certificates of competence, and that supervisory personnel have received suitable training in health and safety management.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Plant and equipment management responsibilities require subcontractors to ensure that all construction plant and equipment brought onto construction sites complies with the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 and the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998. This includes ensuring that thorough examinations and inspections are carried out in accordance with regulatory requirements, that comprehensive maintenance records are maintained, and that operators are competent and authorised to use the equipment. Subcontractors must also ensure that appropriate certificates and documentation are available for inspection, and that any defects or safety concerns are immediately reported and addressed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Emergency preparedness and incident management represent critical aspects of subcontractor responsibilities, requiring them to develop and maintain comprehensive emergency procedures that address the specific risks associated with their work activities. This includes ensuring that their personnel are trained in emergency procedures, that appropriate rescue equipment is available where required, and that they can respond effectively to a wide range of construction-related emergencies. Under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (RIDDOR), subcontractors must ensure that all reportable incidents involving their personnel are properly investigated, documented and reported to the relevant authorities within the required timescales.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Communication and coordination responsibilities require subcontractors to maintain effective liaison with the principal contractor, other subcontractors, and client representatives throughout the duration of their work. This includes participating in regular coordination meetings, providing timely information about potential hazards or changes in working methods, and responding promptly to health and safety concerns raised by others. Subcontractors must also ensure that they provide comprehensive information about their work activities, including details of hazardous substances to be used, potential environmental impacts, and any specialist equipment or procedures required. The maintenance of high standards of site housekeeping and welfare provision is essential, with subcontractors being responsible for ensuring that their work areas are kept tidy and well-organised, that waste materials are properly disposed of, and that appropriate welfare facilities are provided for their personnel where shared facilities are not available.</p></div>';
