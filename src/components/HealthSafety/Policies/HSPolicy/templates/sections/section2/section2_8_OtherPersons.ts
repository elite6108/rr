export const SECTION2_8_OTHER_PERSONS_TEMPLATE = '<div class="con"><p style="text-align: justify;">All other persons who may be present on construction sites or within construction-related premises, including visitors, delivery drivers, client representatives, design consultants, quantity surveyors, building control officers, and members of the public, have important responsibilities under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. Section 8 of the Act places a duty on all persons not to interfere with or misuse anything provided in the interests of health, safety or welfare, whilst Section 7 requires that reasonable care is taken for their own safety and that of others who may be affected by their acts or omissions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015, all persons working on construction sites must cooperate with the principal contractor and other contractors to enable compliance with health and safety duties. This includes following site-specific health and safety rules and procedures, attending site induction sessions where required, and complying with any restrictions or requirements imposed for their own safety and that of others. Visitors and other persons must also ensure that they are competent to carry out any work they are required to undertake, or that they are under adequate supervision by a competent person.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The requirement for appropriate personal protective equipment compliance extends to all persons on construction sites, regardless of their role or the duration of their visit. Under the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 2022, all persons must use any PPE provided by the site operator, ensure that it is properly fitted and maintained, and report any defects or concerns immediately. In construction environments, this typically includes hard hats, high-visibility clothing, and safety footwear as a minimum requirement, with additional PPE such as eye protection, hearing protection, or respiratory protective equipment being required for specific areas or activities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Emergency procedures and evacuation arrangements must be understood and followed by all persons present on construction sites. This includes understanding the location of emergency exits, assembly points, and emergency equipment, as well as the procedures to be followed in the event of fire, structural collapse, or other construction-related emergencies. All persons must also understand the site-specific communication systems, including the use of emergency alarms and the procedures for summoning assistance in the event of an accident or emergency.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hazard awareness and risk recognition represent fundamental requirements for all persons working in or visiting construction environments. This includes understanding the potential hazards associated with construction activities such as working at height, moving plant and equipment, lifting operations, and excavation work, as well as recognising the control measures that have been implemented to manage these risks. All persons must also be aware of any restricted areas or activities that may present particular dangers, and must comply with any exclusion zones or access restrictions that have been established.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The reporting of hazards, incidents, and safety concerns is a responsibility that extends to all persons present on construction sites, regardless of their role or employment status. This includes immediately reporting any unsafe conditions, defective equipment, or dangerous practices to the site management team, as well as reporting any accidents, incidents, or near misses that they witness or are involved in. All persons must also comply with site rules regarding alcohol and drugs, recognising that impairment can significantly increase the risk of accidents in construction environments, and must not engage in any behaviour that could endanger themselves or others. The cooperation and coordination with site management and other personnel is essential for maintaining safe working conditions, requiring all persons to follow instructions from authorised personnel, participate in safety briefings and meetings as required, and contribute positively to the maintenance of high health and safety standards throughout the construction site.</p></div>';
