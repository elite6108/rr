Section 7 of the Act places specific duties on employees to take reasonable care for their own health and safety and that of others who may be affected by their acts or omissions at work. This responsibility extends to cooperating with their employer and others to ensure that statutory duties and requirements are met, and to not intentionally or recklessly interfere with or misuse anything provided in the interests of health, safety or welfare.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015, all construction workers have specific duties to ensure that they are competent to carry out the work they are required to undertake, or are under adequate supervision by a competent person. Workers must cooperate with their employer, other contractors, and the principal contractor to enable compliance with health and safety duties, and must report any situation that presents a serious and immediate danger to health and safety, or any shortcomings in the health and safety arrangements. This includes ensuring that they understand and follow method statements and risk assessments, use appropriate personal protective equipment, and comply with site-specific health and safety requirements.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The proper use and maintenance of construction plant and equipment represents a critical responsibility for all construction workers. Under the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998, workers must use equipment only for the purposes for which it is intended, follow manufacturers\' instructions and workplace procedures, and report any defects or safety concerns immediately. When working with lifting equipment, workers must comply with the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998, ensuring that they are competent to carry out lifting operations, that load limits are not exceeded, and that appropriate communication and coordination procedures are followed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Personal protective equipment compliance is mandatory under the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 2022, requiring workers to use PPE properly, maintain it in good condition, and report any defects or shortcomings to their supervisor. In the construction industry, this typically includes hard hats, high-visibility clothing, safety footwear, eye protection, hearing protection, and respiratory protective equipment as required by the specific work activities. Workers must also comply with the Work at Height Regulations 2005 when working at height, using fall protection equipment properly, following safe systems of work, and not placing themselves or others at unnecessary risk.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Chemical and substance safety awareness is essential for construction workers who may be exposed to hazardous substances including cement, solvents, adhesives, and other construction materials. Under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 (COSHH), workers must follow safe working procedures, use appropriate control measures, and undergo health surveillance where required. This includes reading and understanding safety data sheets, using appropriate personal protective equipment, and reporting any health concerns that may be related to exposure to hazardous substances.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Incident reporting and emergency response represent important aspects of individual responsibility in construction environments. Workers must report all accidents, incidents, near misses, and dangerous occurrences to their supervisor immediately, providing accurate information to support investigation and prevention activities. In emergency situations, workers must follow established procedures, evacuate when required, and assist in rescue activities only if they are competent to do so safely. The maintenance of good housekeeping standards and safe working practices is the responsibility of all construction workers, requiring them to keep work areas tidy, ensure that materials and equipment are properly stored, and not create hazards for themselves or others. Workers must also comply with site rules regarding alcohol, drugs, and smoking, recognising that impairment can significantly increase the risk of accidents and injuries in construction environments.</p></div>';
