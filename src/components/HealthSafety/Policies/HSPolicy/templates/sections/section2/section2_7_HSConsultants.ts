export const SECTION2_7_HS_CONSULTANTS_TEMPLATE = '<div class="con"><p style="text-align: justify;">Health and Safety Consultants engaged by construction organisations serve as specialist advisers, providing expert guidance on complex health and safety matters that require specialised knowledge and experience. Under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, employers must appoint competent persons to assist them in undertaking the measures necessary to comply with health and safety legislation. In the construction industry, this role is particularly important given the complex regulatory environment and the high-risk nature of construction activities, requiring consultants to possess detailed knowledge of construction-specific legislation including the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015, the Work at Height Regulations 2005, and the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The provision of specialist advice on regulatory compliance forms a core function of health and safety consultants, requiring them to maintain up-to-date knowledge of current legislation, approved codes of practice, and industry guidance. This includes advising on the interpretation and application of the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015, ensuring that clients understand their duties as contractors, principal contractors, or designers as applicable. Consultants must also provide guidance on the appointment of competent persons, the development of construction phase plans, and the coordination of health and safety measures throughout the project lifecycle. Their expertise extends to advising on compliance with specialist regulations such as the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002, the Noise at Work Regulations 2005, and the Control of Vibration at Work Regulations 2005.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Risk assessment and method statement development represent key areas of consultant expertise, requiring them to work closely with construction teams to identify hazards, assess risks, and develop appropriate control measures for complex construction activities. This includes providing guidance on the assessment of risks associated with working at height, excavation work, demolition activities, and the use of specialist construction plant and equipment. Consultants must ensure that risk assessments are suitable and sufficient, that they address all relevant hazards, and that they result in the implementation of effective control measures that reduce risks to an acceptable level.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Training and competence development services provided by health and safety consultants are essential for ensuring that construction personnel at all levels possess the knowledge and skills necessary to work safely. This includes the development and delivery of site-specific training programmes, the provision of toolbox talks on current health and safety topics, and the assessment of competence for specialist roles such as appointed persons for lifting operations, confined space entry supervisors, and first aiders. Consultants must ensure that training programmes are appropriate for the target audience, that they address the specific hazards and risks associated with construction activities, and that they result in measurable improvements in health and safety performance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Incident investigation and analysis services require consultants to possess the skills and experience necessary to conduct thorough investigations of construction accidents and incidents, identify root causes, and develop recommendations for preventing recurrence. This includes ensuring compliance with the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (RIDDOR), providing guidance on the investigation of serious incidents, and liaising with enforcement authorities as required. Consultants must also provide statistical analysis of accident and incident data, identifying trends and patterns that may indicate systemic health and safety issues requiring attention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Audit and inspection services provided by health and safety consultants involve the systematic examination of construction activities, workplace conditions, and management systems to assess compliance with legal requirements and industry best practices. This includes conducting comprehensive health and safety audits, carrying out workplace inspections, and reviewing documentation such as risk assessments, method statements, and training records. Consultants must provide clear, actionable recommendations for improvement, assist with the development of action plans, and provide ongoing support to ensure that identified issues are effectively addressed. Their role also encompasses liaison with enforcement authorities, including the Health and Safety Executive and local authority inspectors, providing support during inspections and investigations, and assisting with the resolution of enforcement actions where these arise.</p></div>';
