export const SECTION3_SITE_WELFARE_FACILITIES_TEMPLATE = '<div class="con"><p style="text-align: justify; ">We are responsible for providing or making available such welfare facilities as necessary for our employees and others.&nbsp; The welfare facilities should be sufficient for everybody who is working on the site and can be arranged separately or jointly with others under Shared Welfare arrangements.  When working on Clientâ€™s premises carrying out small works operations, often the Client will be in the position to provide suitable welfare facilities.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">The status of the Company on site would determine whether the Company\'s Site Management would be in control of the site welfare facilities that would also include first aid provisions. On most sites, it is best that the Managing Contractor/Main Contractor/Client etc., provides all the necessary welfare facilities and that they offer those provisions under Shared Welfare arrangements. </p><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Sanitary Conveniences:</strong>  The number of toilets required will depend on the number of people working on the site.  Wherever possible, toilets should be flushed by water, but if this is not possible, use chemical toilets.  Rooms containing sanitary conveniences should be adequately ventilated and lit.  Men and women may use the same toilet, provided it is in a lockable room and is suitably positioned away from any urinals that may also have been provided.  A wash basin with water, soap and towels or dryers should be close to the toilets if the toilets are not near the other washing facilities provided on the site.</p><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Washing Facilities: </strong>On all sites there must be wash basins large enough to allow people to wash their faces, hands and forearms.  All basins should have a supply of clean hot and cold, or warm water.  If mains water is not available, water supplied from a tank may be used.  Soap and towels (either cloth or paper) or dryers should also be provided.  Where the work is particularly dirty or workers are exposed to toxic or corrosive substances, for example, during work in contaminated ground, showers may be needed. Full consideration must be given to comply with the COSHH Assessment Control Measures where hazardous substances are concerned.  Men and women can share basins for washing their hands, faces and arms.  Both men and women may use a shower provided that it is in a separate, lockable room so that one person can use the room at a time.  Rooms containing washing facilities should be sufficiently ventilated and lit. Washing facilities must be provided adjacent to all drying rooms and sanitary conveniences.</p><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Drinking Water:</strong>  Make sure there is a supply of drinking water.  It is best if a tap direct from the mains is available, otherwise bottles or tanks of water may be used.  If water is stored, it should be protected from possible contamination and changed often enough to prevent it from becoming stale or contaminated.  Containers of drinking water must be clearly marked.  Drinking water taps should be clearly marked and cups or other drinking vessels should be available at the water tap, unless the water is supplied as an upward jet that can be drunk from easily (for example, a drinking fountain).</p><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Storage and changing of clothing:</strong>    Make sure there are arrangements for storing clothing not worn on site and for protective clothing needed for site works. </p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Where there is a risk of protective site clothing contaminating everyday clothing, these items should be stored separately.  Where men and women are working on site, separate changing arrangements must be provided.  There should be somewhere to dry wet site clothing.</p><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Rest Facilities:</strong>  Facilities for rest and meal breaks should be available.  The facilities should provide shelter from the wind and rain and be heated as necessary.  The rest facilities should have tables and chairs, a kettle or urn for boiling water and a means for preparing food. </p><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Smoking:</strong>  It should be possible for non-smokers to use the facilities without suffering the discomfort from tobacco smoke, It may be possible to prevent discomfort by increasing ventilation.  If this cannot be done, it may be necessary to provide separate facilities for smokers and non-smokers, or to prohibit smoking in the presence of non-smokers.</p><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Location of Welfare Facilities:</strong>  Welfare facilities should be easily available to people working on the site.  Toilets need to be easily accessible from where the work is being carried out.  Hand basins should be close to toilets.  Washing facilities need to be near rest rooms so that it is convenient for people to wash before eating.  In most cases these facilities will be provided on site.  Where work is done at occupied premises, arrangements can be made with the occupier to use the facilities provided for the people who normally use the premises. In some cases, welfare and toilet facilities may be made available in nearby premises.  This is acceptable, providing these arrangements are clear and agreed with the occupier of the premises.  Such arrangements may be appropriate for short duration work or work done by mobile gangs.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">If mobile gangs are being employed at work at a number of locations over a few days, facilities can be provided at a central location.  This is on condition that they are available to workers within reasonable walking distance or within a reasonable time, taking into account any transport which is available.  Alternatively, arrangements can be made at local houses, cafes or other premises.  However, these arrangements should be made and agreed in advance by Managers or Supervisors of the Company.  Arrangements with local cafes etc., would not be suitable where employees need suitable facilities for personal hygiene regarding hazardous substances or contaminated sites etc.  Workers should not be left to make their own arrangements.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">All welfare facilities must be kept clean and if food is stored on site, it must be kept in a hygienic manner and at the correct temperature.  The changing of clothing or the storage of equipment and tools are not allowed in the canteen.  Food scraps and rubbish must be removed from sites as soon as possible.  All personnel should change their clothing and wash themselves before taking meals particularly when working in environmental conditions that have exposed them to bacteria and harmful substances.</p></div>';
