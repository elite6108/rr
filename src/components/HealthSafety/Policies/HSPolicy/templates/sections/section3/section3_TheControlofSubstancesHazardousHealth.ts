Management have a responsibility to carry out a COSHH, Assessment for substances that could be hazardous to health and to have in place a management system for checking that the control measures required are in order. The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 defines in general and specific terms how we are expected to safely manage the use of potentially harmful substances. The Regulations are structured to describe a management strategy.</p><ul><li>Assess the hazards and risks to health<br></li><li>Implement a control programme</li><li>Ensure that controls are being used properly and maintained</li><li>Where necessary, monitor the control measures</li><li>Where necessary, measure workers exposure</li><li>Where necessary, carry out medical surveillance</li><li>Inform, instruct and train persons likely to be affected about the risks and precautions</li><li>The keeping of records</li><li>All suppliers and sub-contractors must provide full COSHH information on any hazards associated with equipment or materials supplied by us. This information must be passed to the relevant supervision for assessment before potentially hazardous equipment and materials are used.
