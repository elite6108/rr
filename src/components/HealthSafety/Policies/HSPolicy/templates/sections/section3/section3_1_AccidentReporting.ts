In pursuance of this goal it is essential that a comprehensive accident and incident recording system is in place and that all accidents, injuries and near misses are recorded, reported, analysed and followed up with a positive action.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Reporting and investigation are considered an essential reactive measurement and control tool to prevent a recurrence of similar events and circumstances.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">This section of the policy sets out the responsibilities of staff and the procedures to be complied with following accidents and incidents involving our operations.</p><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Internal Reporting:</strong>  The Internal Incident reporting system will apply to all individuals working on behalf of the business.  It also applies to near miss occurrences – i.e. incidents in which there is no resulting injury and for incidents where only property damage is the outcome.</p><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Accident Book: </strong> Following any work-related accident or incident, regardless of how trivial it may seem, to an employee or visitor, the company accident book must be completed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">In addition to the above employees working on a client\'s premises or site must comply with the site accident book/reporting procedures conveyed during the site safety induction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">It is the responsibility of the individual to report accidents and incidents in which they are involved.  Where this is not possible, a supervisor or colleague should report the accident or incident on their behalf.</p><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Near Misses: </strong>These are incidents that have not resulted in any injury or damage to either persons or property.  The fact that there was no material consequence however does not remove the need to record and report the incident.  Often the lack of injury or damage is more due to good fortune than design, it is essential therefore, that these events are identified and controlled before a similar incident results in a more serious consequence.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">We fully embraces a positive near miss reporting culture and actively promote and encourage the participation of all of our employees in ensuring that these events are reported when encountered.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">It is our policy to report to a Manager, Supervisor or direct to the person responsible for health &amp; safety&nbsp; any incident that an individual perceives to be a near miss.  It also expected of all site-based employees to comply 100% with the near miss reporting policy of the client or principal contractor.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Near misses will not be recorded in the accident book, however upon receiving a report they will trigger an internal investigation process which will be completed by a Manager.  The process will be recorded on an internal report.  Upon completion, it will be forwarded to the person responsible for health and safety. They will ensure that the Health &amp; Consultants have received a copy.</p><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Minor Injuries:</strong>  These are injuries, which either require very basic first aid treatment or no treatment at all.  Injuries associated with this category fall outside the scope of RIDDOR 2013 and the prescribed reporting procedures that must then be followed. They may not prevent the person from carrying out their normal duties.  Minor Injuries will trigger an entry into the accident book and an internal investigation process which will be completed by a Manager.  The process will be recorded on an internal report.  Upon completion it will be forwarded to the person responsible for health and safety. They will ensure that the Health &amp; Consultants have received a copy</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In every case the Manager must carry out an investigation into the causes and preventative measures required to be taken to prevent a recurrence. The level of investigation will be determined by the severity or seriousness of the accident or incident.
