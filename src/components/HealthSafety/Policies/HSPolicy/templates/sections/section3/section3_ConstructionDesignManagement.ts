">The Regulations place duties on all parties involved in construction work, from clients, through the design team and into construction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="background-color: var(--white);">For all projects, irrespective of size and value, the client must ensure competent contractors are selected and health and safety is given due regard, through proper planning and management of construction hazards.</span><br></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="background-color: var(--white);">If the project involves more than one contractor, the client must appoint a competent principal designer to ensure health &amp; safety is taken into account at the design &amp; planning stage of the project.&nbsp; As the design is finalised the principal designer will produce Pre-Construction Information for the project, identifying the specific design hazards which the contractors will encounter, together with details of the design stage risk assessments produced by the designers.&nbsp; Contractors should be given this essential health and safety information at tender stage.</span><br></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="background-color: var(--white);">At the same time the client should also appoint a competent Principal Contractor to manage and co-ordinate health &amp; safety activities on site.&nbsp; The Principal Contractor must develop the pre-construction information into an initial construction phase health &amp; safety plan, detailing how they intend to manage the project, provide details of the site rules, emergency procedures and welfare arrangements.</span><br></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="background-color: var(--white);">As the construction phase commences, the principal designer should discuss and agree with the Principal Contractor the style and content of the health &amp; safety file.&nbsp; This will enable the Principal Contractor to start collating the necessary information from suppliers and sub contractors, making it much easier for both the Principal Contractor and principal designers to produce the health &amp; safety file at the end of the project.</span><br></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="background-color: var(--white);">The client must ensure the principal designer; Principal Contractor and contractors can demonstrate they have the relevant resources, experiences, knowledge and skill to enable them the competently fulfil their appointment.&nbsp; Providing the person or Company has sufficient competence, the person or Company could be appointed as both principal designer and Principal Contractor.&nbsp; If within the clients undertaking, there is sufficiently skilled and competent staff, then the client could also take the role of principal designer and / or Principal Contractor if they so wished.</span><br></p><p style="text-align: justify;
