Information concerning the safe use of tools should always be requested from the manufacturers/suppliers who by law are required to provide such information.  Tools should be regularly checked on issue from and on return to the store.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Employees must only operate equipment for which they have been thoroughly trained and use the correct tools and equipment for the job.  Ensure that equipment issued is accompanied with the operators instructions and check that the equipment is safe and fully efficient.  Equipment should be guarded and equipped with safety devices where required and tested in accordance with all the current Regulations.  Defects in equipment and tools should be reported immediately to your Superior. </p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Do not use unsafe defective equipment until it has been put back in good safe condition.  Do not attempt to repair or maintain equipment unless you have been properly trained to do so, particularly when it may involve the removal of safety guards or live electrics.  Ensure that guard protection is always in place where required.  Ensure the working environment meets the safety requirements for operating the type of equipment and tools you require to use, i.e., adequate space and lighting etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Pneumatic Tools</strong>:  Compressed air is delivered at high pressure.  If it enters the body it can rupture internal organs and cause death.  Any form of horseplay or misuse should be expressly forbidden.</p><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Compressors:</strong>  Should always be under the supervision of a competent person who should be responsible for ensuring that the machine is kept in good order, i.e., making sure that feed belt and pulley drives are guarded, that hoses and couplings are maintained in good order and that regular checks are made to ensure that oil feed to the airline is properly topped up.  Air receivers must be marked with a safe working pressure and distinguishing number.  They must also be fitted with safety valves, pressure gauge, drain cock and manhole.  Hose connections must be properly clamped - it can be dangerous to have loose or over-tightened connections.  Air receivers must be cleaned and thoroughly examined.</p><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Cartridge Operated Tools:</strong>  Should only be used by properly trained and certificated persons over the age of 18 years.  Supervised test runs are always advisable before the method of using the cartridge operated tools are put into general practice on site.  When operating cartridge tools, operators should wear head, ear and eye protection.  Major hazards in using cartridge tools apart from malevolent firing are as follows:</p><p></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Where material is of a soft nature, the fastener can puncture and emerge from the other side like a bullet</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Where the material is brittle or of uneven constituency, the fixing device may turn back on itself and injure the operator</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The material may splinter at the point of impact</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Recoil, which can throw the operator off balance</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Excessive noise levels in certain circumstances, for example, confined spaces.</li></ul></div>';
