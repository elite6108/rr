Where there is a risk of crushing, a suitable restraint system should always be provided for anyone being carried, unless such a system would:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">increase the overall risk to safety<br></li><li style="text-align: justify;">make the equipment significantly more difficult to operate (and thus not be reasonably practicable)</li><li style="text-align: justify;">not be reasonably practicable to put in place (e.g. for very old equipment, in use at work before 5/12/1998)</li><li style="text-align: justify;">fork lift trucks with either a mast or ROPS should, if not already fitted, be provided with restraint systems (e.g. a seat belt) where appropriate, if such systems can be fitted to the equipment, to prevent workers carried from being crushed between any part of the truck and the ground, should it overturn.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify; ">We will ensure our mobile work equipment has:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">facilities to prevent the equipment being started by unauthorised people<br></li><li style="text-align: justify;">facilities to minimise the consequences of collision, where there is more than one rail-mounted item in motion at the same time</li><li style="text-align: justify;">a device for braking and stopping</li><li style="text-align: justify;">(where required) emergency facilities for braking and stopping, operated by readily accessible controls or automatic systems - in the event of failure of the main facility</li><li style="text-align: justify;">adequate devices for improving driver vision, so far as reasonably practicable, where the driver\'s direct field of vision is inadequate to ensure safety - modern CCTV systems can be very effective where mirrors are found to be inadequate</li><li style="text-align: justify;">appropriate lighting, where used at night or in dark places, so the work activity can be carried out safely</li><li style="text-align: justify;">carries (or have located close by) appropriate fire-fighting equipment, when carrying or towing anything which could present a fire hazard and endanger employees</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify; ">Those who provide remote-controlled, self-propelled work equipment must:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">ensure there is a means to stop it safely and automatically when it leaves its control range, if it presents a risk to safety while in motion<br></li><li style="text-align: justify;">provide features to safeguard against crushing or impact with other machinery, obstacles or people</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify; ">Where the seizure of a drive shaft, between mobile work equipment and its accessories or anything being towed, is likely to involve a risk to safety, it must have means either to prevent seizure or the adverse effects of seizure.
