export const SECTION3_LIFTING_OPERATIONS_TEMPLATE = '<div class="con"><p style="text-align: justify; ">The Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 apply to these activities. Irrespective as to whether we hire or own the lifting equipment or lifting accessory, there is a duty to ensure a current thorough examination certificate is in place for the item. In practice this means the site manager / supervisor must have a copy of the thorough examination certificate before allowing the machine to commence work.</p><p style="text-align: justify; "><b>Thorough Examination of Lifting Equipment:&nbsp;</b> A competent person must carry out a thorough examination in accordance with a written scheme or at least once in every period of 12 months. However, if the lifting equipment is used to carry people, the thorough examination must be carried out at least once in every 6 months.<br></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><b>Lifting Accessories:</b>&nbsp; i.e. slings shackles etc, have to be thoroughly examined at least once in every 6 months or as specified by the competent person on the last thorough examination report or in the written scheme. The site manager must have a copy of the current thorough examination certificate on site before allowing the items to be used.<br></p><p style="text-align: justify; ">In addition to the Thorough examination, an appropriate inspection by a competent person must be completed weekly by a competent person such as the slinger/signaller or equipment operator. The results of the inspection should be recorded in a register. If the inspection shows there are faults with the equipment, these faults must be brought to the attention of the owner of the equipment without delay and the item being removed out of service, by placing it is a secure Quarantine Area)<br></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><b>Management of Lifting Operations:&nbsp;</b> If lifting operations such as crane lifts have to take place, these have to be properly planned and managed. An Appointed Person should plan the lift. A Lift Supervisor should be present and supervise the actual lifting operation. The degree of competence and qualification of the people holding these positions should reflect the complexity of the lift. For simple operations this could well be the site manager and machine operator, but for complex crane lifts this may have to be trained persons, together with trained banksman and slingers. In general we will use the ‘contract lift’ option from the crane or lift hire company.<br></p></div>';
