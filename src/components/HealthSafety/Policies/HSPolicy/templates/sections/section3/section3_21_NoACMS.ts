To ensure / minimise such a situation arising, when tendering for any works on building constructed before 1999,we will insist on a R&amp;D asbestos survey report undertaken by an accredited asbestos survey Company.  If the survey indicates there is asbestos containing materials in or close to any areas to be worked,we will arrange with client for asbestos removal and the necessary asbestos clearance certification being issued prior to&nbsp; works being started.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">This is in accordance with the requirements and guidance under Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012.  Where operatives undertake works that may involve ACMs, operatives shall be trained to minimum of asbestos awareness standards.  This will provide operatives with the foundation knowledge about ACMs and facilitate the full implementation of our policy for ceasing works where asbestos is suspected to be present.  This training shall be refresher trained every 12 months by the completion of a detailed toolbox talk confirming policy, identifying any new procedures or industry practices etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">In the event of an asbestos incident where asbestos is suspected to be present in a location where it has not been identified, or asbestos exposure may have occurred, or non-compliance with asbestos controls etc. need to be reported, the Site Manager must be informed immediately for further advice and to ensure full compliance with any Clientâ€™s emergency procedures.

If not practical to remove clothing, obtain assistance to lightly wet down the clothing (i.e. with wet wipes or a damp rag) to prevent the fibres being dispersed. Remove the contaminated clothing as soon as possible and seal in a bin liner.
