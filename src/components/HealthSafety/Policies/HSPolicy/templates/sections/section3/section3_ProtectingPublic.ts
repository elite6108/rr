export const SECTION3_PROTECTING_PUBLIC_TEMPLATE = '<div class="con"><p style="text-align: justify; ">The general public is defined for the purpose of this Safety Policy as any person who is not employed by the Company:</p><p></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Employees of neighbouring businesses</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Visitors to us and neighbouring business premises</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Pedestrians and road users</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Any persons who could be affected by Company activities on site locations.</li></ul><p></p><p style="text-align: justify; ">General public areas must be kept free from any unsafe obstructions and activities that could be a hazard e.g. re-texturing of granite paving slabs using oxy-acetylene torches.  Where general public areas have to be guarded-off due to the nature of work, all necessary temporary safeguards must be provided and adequate control measures put in place.  Areas of possible danger to the general public must be safely guarded-off and appropriate warning notices displayed.  Those that could be affected by the works must be notified in advance wherever possible so that where necessary, their normal safety arrangements can accommodate additional safety provisions necessary for the safe use of temporary works.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Where pavements could be affected by the works all appropriate signs and guards must be displayed.  Temporary walkways for pedestrians must be at a safe distance from the work.  The walkways should be defined with red and white continuous rigid guard-rails and toe boards or hoarding.  Where temporary pedestrian walkways have to be located in roads, red and white secured road timbers should be used instead of toe boards and all appropriate road signs/lights and cones must be displayed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Where pavements are required for closure, our safety advisors and the Local Highways Department/Local Council must be informed so that all appropriate precautions and controls are taken.  Note:  Pavements are used by mothers pushing prams, children, blind and disabled persons as well as ordinary pedestrians and they must all be considered when diverting/closing pavements.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Trespassers safety must also be considered so they are protected from danger.  There is a particularly strong liability towards children who may be \'attracted\' onto our premises or site works after working hours. The precautions to exclude children depend on circumstances.  If it is reasonably foreseeable that a child might gain access, the precautions, which have been taken, are not sufficient.  Every reasonable precaution must be taken to keep trespassers out of Company premises and sites.  Considerations must be given to safeguard trespassers should they gain entry, e.g., Guard dogs must be under control.  Machinery, plant and equipment should be left immobilised (disconnected/locked off) and in a safe condition.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Third Parties and Visitors:  We have a responsibility not to jeopardise any persons safety.  This covers not only Employees, but also the Client\'s Employees, Sub-Contractor\'s Employees, Visitors and persons making deliveries, etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Where third parties or visitors are allowed onto our Premises or site locations, they should be made aware of safety standards and any special hazards. They should be accompanied by a responsible person and provided with protective clothing/equipment where appropriate.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Site working areas must be suitably guarded/cordoned-off and appropriate safety signs displayed, particularly scaffold working platforms where the protection preventing persons from falling has been temporarily affected, at the base areas where hoists are being erected, areas where persons could be struck by hoist platforms and areas of potential fall of materials, etc.</p></div>';
