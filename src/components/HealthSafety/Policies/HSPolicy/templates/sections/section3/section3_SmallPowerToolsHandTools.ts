export const SECTION3_SMALL_POWER_TOOLS_HAND_TOOLS_TEMPLATE = '<div class="con"><p>Small power tools and hand tools are much abused items in the workplace.&nbsp; In line with industry standards, power tools are limited&nbsp; to 110 volts or lower. The inspection procedures still need to be adequate to identify faults on a reasonably regular basis. Users of the equipment should inspect the tools before each use, and tools and equipment that are available for general use must be inspected in accordance with our procedures. When returned to the yard, store etc, the equipment should be \'IN\' inspected to check it is still fit for use, before being made available again.</p><p>Hand tools can cause serious injury if not looked after.&nbsp; Once issued, the user is responsible for ensuring it remains fit for use,&nbsp; Do not use the tool for anything other than its designed purpose.&nbsp; Keep sharp edges clean and free from burrs, nicks etc, and replace loose handled tools and split/mushroom headed tools before they cause injury.<br></p></div>';
