export const SECTION3_MOBILE_ELEVATING_WORK_PLATFORM_TEMPLATE = '<div class="con"><p style="text-align: justify; ">There are many types of access platform available and for some jobs they may provide a more suitable alternative to ladders, scaffolding etc, but some basic rules should be followed:</p><p></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Never attempt to operate an access platform unless you have been properly trained and competent and authorised to do so</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Ensure that the unit is on firm, level ground</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Follow the manufacturer’s instructions with regards to outriggers, screw jacks stabilisers, maximum safe working load, wind loadings, and tyre pressures</li></ul><p></p><p style="text-align: justify; ">A current thorough examination certificate must be available for the equipment. The equipment must satisfy the requirements of PUWER ’98 with regards to stability and security of the equipment.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Operatives should be trained and certificated in the operation of MEWPs.  Training means more than familiarisation with the machine at the time of delivery and we will expect operatives to have undertaken a formal training course such as the CITB approved or IPAF course.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">With regards to the use of a work restraint system (a harness, lanyard and anchor point) in which the length of the lanyard is such that the wearer cannot fall from the working platform, the HSE guidance advises work restraint systems should be used for high risk operations such as:</p><p></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Protruding building or structural features that could catch or trap the basket</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Use adjacent to plant or transport operations that could strike the MEWP</li><li style="text-align: justify;">If the operative has to or is likely to lean out of the basket or over reach</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Working with awkward work pieces that could move unexpectedly</li><li style="text-align: justify;">If the basket could jerk or move suddenly</li></ul><p></p><p style="text-align: justify; ">In all these situations a full body harness secured to the anchor point in the platform must be used.  In practice operatives working from cherry pickers or telescopic type MEWPs should use a work restraint system at all times.  When using scissors lifts, an assessment must be made and if the work is high risk as defined above then a harness must be used.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">A MEWP requires a 6 monthly (LOLER) thorough examination undertaken by a competent person such as an insurance engineering inspector.  The supervisor accepting delivery of the MEWP must ensure the thorough examination certificate is provided with the machine.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The operator should check the machine daily before use.  In addition, on a weekly basis the nominated competent person (who may also be the operator) should check the machine and record the inspection in the site inspection register.</p></div>';
