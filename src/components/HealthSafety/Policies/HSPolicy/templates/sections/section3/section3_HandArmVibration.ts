export const SECTION3_HAND_ARM_VIBRATION_TEMPLATE = '<div class="con" style="display: block;"><p>Employees who are regularly exposed to high vibration can have conditions such as ‘dead finger’ or ‘dead hand’, which is caused by damage to the blood vessels or blood supply. Damage to nerves of the finger causing permanent loss of feeling and other damage to muscles and bone may also contribute to pain and stiffness in the hands and wrists.</p><p>Whole body vibration can also cause damage to the spine or vertebrae after long exposure. Symptoms of vibration white finger are usually set off by the cold, with early indications of the fingertips rapidly becoming pale and loss of feeling. These attacks can produce numbness and ‘pins and needles’. This phase is followed by an intense red flush (sometimes preceded by a dusky bluish phase) signalling the return of blood circulation to the fingers and is usually accompanied by an uncomfortable throbbing. Continued work will see the affected area becoming larger.<br></p><p><b>Control Measures for reducing the risk of vibration exposure</b><br></p><p>The control measures to be implemented to ensure compliance with the above regulations is achieved will include:<br></p><ul><li>assessing the vibration risk to our employees<br></li><li>deciding if they are likely to be exposed above the daily exposure action value (EAV) and if they are introduce a programme of controls to eliminate risk, or reduce exposure to as low a level as is reasonably practicable, and provide health surveillance (regular health checks) to those employees who continue to be regularly exposed above the action value or otherwise continue to be at risk</li><li>deciding if they are likely to be exposed above the daily exposure limit value (ELV) and if they are, take immediate action to reduce their exposure below the limit value</li><li>providing information and training to employees on health risks and the actions you are taking to control those risks</li><li>consulting the safety representative or employee representative on your proposals to control risk and to provide health surveillance</li><li>keeping a record of your risk assessment and control actions</li><li>keeping health records for employees under health surveillance</li><li>reviewing and update your risk assessment regularly</li></ul><p><b>Our strategy for reducing vibration&nbsp;</b></p><p>We will&nbsp; risk assess all work tasks, during which the following issues should be addressed:<br></p><ul><li>can the job be done without using high vibration tools? If this is not possible, is it feasible to reduce the vibration levels of the tools to be used?<br></li><li>ensuring that any new tools have vibration controls built in. All tools, whether supplied new or secondhand, should be safe to use and handle in compliance with the requirements of the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 and relevant British Standards</li><li>arranging for operatives to stay warm by providing heating for the workplace and, where possible, suitable clothing and gloves employers will reduce the effect of cold on the operatives’ hands and other parts of the body and help them to identify the symptoms of vibration-induced diseases more quickly</li></ul><p>We will provide training to employees involving the correct use of vibrating tools.&nbsp; They will be helped to recognise the vibration symptoms and the need to report them to the supervisor.</p><p>The company requires employees \'at risk\' to complete a Medical Questionnaire specifically relating to the use of Hand Held Tools. This will be used annually as medical surveillance to assess any possibility of hand/arm vibration syndrome.<br></p><p><b>Preventive measures:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br></p><p>Action taken by the employees to minimise the risk of injury or ill health should include:<br></p><ul><li>the use of working practices which are designed to minimise vibration being directed to the hands, thereby maintaining a good blood circulation to the affected areas;<br></li><li>making sure tools are properly maintained and promptly reporting defects and problems with the equipment to their supervisors and obtaining replacements where necessary.</li></ul><p>Keeping the hands and body warm is essential to help maintain good blood flow to the fingers and reduce the risk of injury. Specific measures might include:</p><ul><li>wearing anti-vibration gloves<br></li><li>using proprietary heating pads for the hands</li><li>using tools with heated handles</li><li>avoiding pneumatic exhausts which discharge towards the hands</li><li>allowing operatives to warm up before starting work, and helping them to stay warm</li><li>wearing warm, weatherproof clothing for cold wet areas</li><li>avoiding or cutting down smoking (smoking reduces blood circulation), and massaging and exercising fingers during work breaks</li></ul><p>An important factor in preventing hand-arm vibration syndrome is by reducing the time which operatives are actually exposed to vibration. In a team of employees, if the use of a vibrating tool is shared between them, as opposed to it only being used by one person all day, then the tool can be kept in use for the full day.</p><p>By splitting up the work in this way and by rotating such personnel not operating the tools at that time to other areas of work will considerably lessen the effects of vibration on the actual user and assist the maintenance of blood circulation, thus lessening the chances of injury or ill health effects being caused by the use of the vibrating tool.<br></p></div>';
