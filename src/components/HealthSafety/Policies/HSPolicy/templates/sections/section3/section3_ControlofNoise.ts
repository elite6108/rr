export const SECTION3_CONTROL_OF_NOISE_TEMPLATE = '<div class="con"><p>We have a duty to protect our employees and others from the effects of noise exposure. We have been provided with action levels to assist in meeting this duty of care.</p><p>An action level is a noise exposure level at which we are required to take certain steps to reduce the harmful effects of noise on hearing. There are two main action levels for continuous noise, 80dB(A) and 85dB(A):<br></p><p><b>The lower exposure action value: </b>is a daily or weekly average noise exposure level of 80 decibels (dB(A)), at which the we have to provide information and training and make hearing protection available. As a guide, an employee may have to shout to be heard at a distance of 2m away from the person they are talking to.<br></p><p><b>The upper exposure action value:</b> is set at a daily or weekly average noise exposure of 85dB(A), above which the employer is required to take reasonably practicable measures to reduce noise exposure, such as engineering controls or other technical measures. The use of hearing protection is also mandatory if the noise cannot be controlled by these measures, or while these measures are being planned or carried out. As a guide, an employee may have to shout to be heard at a distance of 1m away from the person they are talking to.<br></p><p><b>The exposure limit value of 87dB(A):</b> above which no worker can be exposed (taking hearing protection into account).<br></p><p>Exposure to noise levels without protection at these levels, in the long and occasionally in the short term can lead to hearing damage referred to as Noise Induced Hearing Loss:<br></p><p>Symptoms of Noise Induced Hearing Loss:&nbsp; Mild form of noise induced hearing loss. There is sometimes difficulty in conversing with people, wrong answers may be given, and there is also, difficulty in hearing normal environmental sounds, such as a clock ticking.&nbsp; Severe form of noise induced hearing loss. There is difficulty in conversing, even when face to face with people. People will seem to be speaking indistinctly on radio and television and there is an inability to hear the normal environmental sounds of home and street. It is often impossible to tell the direction from which a sound is coming, and to assess the distance from the sound. (This last mentioned feature is a contributory factory in accidents). In the most severe cases, there is a sensation of whistling or ringing in the ear, (tinnitus).<br></p><p>In compliance with the regulations we will conduct suitable and sufficient assessments of the workplace where noise is produced.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The assessment may be structured as follows:<br></p><ul><li>Identify and note down all the work tasks that incorporate excessive noise<br></li><li>Identify all the noise hazards associated with the activity i.e. those aspects (for example equipment, work processes, or work environment) which have the potential to cause harm. When determining noise hazards remember that actual practice may differ from your prescribed practices / procedures; (this is frequently a route whereby risks creep in unnoticed). Always consider the non-routine operations affiliated with the task, e.g. maintenance operations, loading and unloading</li><li>Who Might Be Harmed: Identify All Workers Likely To Be Exposed To the Hazard.&nbsp; Consider others who might be affected. Do not forget maintenance or repair staff, security staff, delivery drivers, subcontractors, visitors, and the general public</li><li>Measuring the Risk: The Level of Noise In dB(A). Arrange for a competent person to carry out a noise assessment, and obtain reliable information about work patterns and the noise sources. In planning, it is important that you consult the affected employees and their safety or employee representatives; this will help ensure co-operation with any control measures that might be needed</li><li>Considering &amp; Implementing Control Measures, consider whether all the existing control measures you have in place are adequate to prevent and protect people from injury. Take into account all of your existing preventative or precautionary control measures.&nbsp; Use the following as a guide to developing an effective and realistic action plan using your noise assessment findings</li></ul><p><b>Elimination:</b> involves removing the hazard completely. This is the most effective method of dealing with a noise hazard. Examples are:</p><ul><li>Purchasing finished components rather than having to grind or polish them on site;<br></li><li>Replace noisy plant or processors by less noisy alternatives</li></ul><p>It is often possible to reduce the risk at source, or to use a safer alternative. The following are examples:</p><ul><li>Ask potential suppliers for information on the noise emission of machines and whether they are likely to cause exposure at or above the first or peak action level.<br></li><li>Changes in technology can alter the machine or process resulting in a lower noise exposure to the workforce. Sometimes a different way of working might avoid the need for a noisy operation.</li></ul><p><b>Control of exposure:&nbsp;</b> These provide you with alternative options for reducing the exposure from a noisy machine or activity, and include:</p><ul><li>Distance - Increasing the distance between noisy equipment / activities and the receiver is often the most effective method of controlling noise<br></li><li>Enclosure involves placing a soundproof cover over the noise source. Noisy machines can be fully or partially enclosed or an acoustic cover can be placed around a noisy part of a machine</li><li>Screens and barriers - This involves placing a physical obstacle between the noise source and the employees. The path between the points at which noise is generated and the workplace/receiver point can sometimes be modified by using screens or barriers</li><li>Noise refuges - The employee workstation itself can be \'enclosed\' by providing a cabin or \'noise refuge\', which is an acoustically designed enclosure (with proper regard for its ventilation and seating arrangement). If controls are brought into the cabin it will be possible to reduce the need to enter noisy areas</li></ul><p><b>Protective devices: </b>can often be provided to minimise the amount of noise produced by the equipment. Examples are:</p><p><b>Avoiding impacts:</b> Try to avoid impacts, or make arrangements to cushion them, for example; ensure that the cutting edge is always sharp on abrasive wheels to reduce the impact noise.</p><p>Damping involves adding material to reduce induced vibrations and the tendency of machine parts to \'ring\', for example; bolt together, instead of welding, the individual steel plates joined to produce large structures. Proprietary magnetic damping material can be obtained.</p><p><b>Isolation:</b> involves separating the machine from its surroundings. Flexible isolators made of rubber or springs can be used to reduce the spread of structure borne sound through a machine frame, for example purchase or hire equipment fitted with anti-vibration mountings to reduce the transmission of sound from hydraulic power supply pipes to the cab floor on an earth-moving machine.</p><p><b>Silencers:</b> are attachments fitted to the inlet or exhaust (or both) of a moving air or gas stream emitted from machines. Mufflers or silencers can reduce noise transmitted along pipes and ducts, for example; exhaust and intake silencers on internal combustion engines; mufflers fitted to pneumatic breakers.<br></p></div>';
