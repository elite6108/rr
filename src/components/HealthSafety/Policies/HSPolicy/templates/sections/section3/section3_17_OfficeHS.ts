export const SECTION3_17_OFFICE_HS_TEMPLATE = '<div class="con" style="display: block;"><p style="text-align: justify; ">In considering the Workplace health Safety and Welfare Regulations, we will ensure that:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Maintenance:</strong> The workplace and associated equipment and systems must be maintained in a clean and efficient state, in efficient working order and in good repair. Statutory records of maintenance and testing for the following shall be kept for:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Gas appliances</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Fire Alarm Systems</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Fire Equipment</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Intruder/Security Systems</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Pressure Systems</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Local Exhaust Ventilation Systems</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Air Conditioning Systems</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Air Handling Systems</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Water Storage Systems</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Asbestos Management Systems</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ventilation:</strong>Where windows or other openings will not provide suitable ventilation, mechanical ventilation systems should be provided and properly maintained.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Temperature:</strong>The temperature in workrooms must be “reasonable” and where practicable, this should normally be at least 16°C. Where work involves significant physical effort, the temperature should be at least 13°C. If, despite measures to heat or cool a workroom, workers are exposed to temperatures, which do not give reasonable comfort, suitable protective clothing and rest facilities should be provided. Sufficient suitable thermometers must be readily available to allow workers to check the temperature in the workplace.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lighting:</strong>Natural lighting should be provided, where reasonably practicable; windows and skylights must therefore be kept clean. Lighting should be sufficient to enable people to work and move safely without visual fatigue. Local lighting should be provided where necessary. Where appropriate, emergency lighting must be provided and maintained</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cleanliness and tidiness:</strong>Floors, walls and ceilings, together with furnishings must be kept sufficiently clean, the standard of cleanliness depending on the use of the workplace. Absorbent floor surfaces, such as untreated concrete or timber, which are likely to be contaminated by oil, grease, etc, should be sealed or coated, e.g., with suitable non-slip floor paint.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Waste, dirt and refuse should be cleared regularly. Furniture, materials and tools should be placed so that they do not cause people to trip or fall and do not obstruct access or fire escape routes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Space:</strong> Workrooms should have enough space to allow people to move with ease.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Workstations &amp; Seating:</strong>Workstations should be arranged so that each task can be carried out safely and comfortably. Seating should, where possible, provide adequate support for the lower back; a footrest should be provided where the foot cannot comfortably be placed flat on the floor.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Floors and Traffic Routes:</strong>Floors of workplaces and surfaces of passages, staircases, access roads, etc., must be suitable for their intended use and properly maintained. Measures must be taken to reduce the risk of persons slipping, tripping and falling, or of vehicles becoming unstable. Any open side of a staircase should be securely fenced by an upper rail at 1100 mm, or higher and a lower rail. A secure and substantial handrail should be fixed on at least one side of every staircase.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Precautions against persons or objects falling (f</strong><strong>encing and covers):</strong> Secure and suitable fencing, guard-rails or covers should normally be provided where persons are liable to fall. Guard-rails should consist of a top rail and at least one intermediate rail should be fixed to prevent persons from falling under the top rail. Where necessary, adequate upstands or toe boards should be fixed to prevent objects falling.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ladders:</strong>Fixed ladders, which include steep stairways should extend at least 1.10m above any landing place that is served. Fixed ladders installed after 31 December 1992, with a vertical height of more than 6m, should have a suitable resting place every 6m. Floor openings for ladders should be as small as possible, with fencing and a gate provided where necessary to prevent falls. Fixed ladders at an angle of less than 15o to the vertical, which are more than 2.5m high, should, where possible, be fitted with safety hoops or permanently fixed fall arrest systems.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Roof Work:</strong> Where frequent access is needed to roofs, suitable fixed, safe means of access should be provided. Compliance with the requirements of the Work at Height Regulations 2005 must be achieved in all instances.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stacking and Racking</strong>: Materials should be stacked and stored in such a way that they are not likely to fall and cause injury. Racking should be of adequate strength and stability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Loading and Unloading Vehicles</strong>: The need to climb on top of vehicles or their loads should be avoided as far as possible. Where this is unavoidable, measures such as fixing fencing on top of a tanker should be taken to prevent falls.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Danger Areas</strong>: Where it is not reasonably practicable to take measures such as the provision of fencing, guard-rails, etc., to prevent falls, entry to such “danger areas” should be restricted to authorised persons who have received adequate information, instruction and training on any appropriate safe system of work. A Permit-to-Work system may be appropriate.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Glazing:</strong> Glazing of doors and walls, which could be broken, accidentally by persons or materials and cause injury, must be made of suitable safety material, or be adequately protected against breakage by suitable screens or barriers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Windows:</strong> Windows, skylights etc., must be capable of being opened and closed without any risk. Windows should be designed, or provisions should be made, to ensure that cleaning could be carried out safely. Window cleaning is subject to the requirements of the Work at Height Regulations 2005.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Doors and Gates</strong>: Doors and gates which swing in both directions should have a transparent panel. On main traffic routes, all doors should be fitted with such panels. Power operated doors and gates must have appropriate safety features to prevent injury to persons where it is possible to be struck by them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Traffic Routes:</strong> Traffic routes must allow the safe movement of persons and vehicles within the workplace and when entering or leaving it. Appropriate measures may include: clearly marked separate routes for pedestrians and vehicles; fitting reversing alarms to vehicles; appointment of a banksman to supervise safe movement of vehicles; display warning signs to alert drivers to restrictions in force; setting speed limits for vehicles and installing road humps; warning indication of height limitations or obstructions; use of one-way systems for vehicles; wearing of high visibility clothing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sanitary Conveniences and Washing Facilities:</strong> Suitable and sufficient facilities must be provided for the maximum number of persons likely to be at work in a workplace at any one time. Warm water, must always be provided but, in some cases, the provision of showers and/or baths may be appropriate.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Drinking Water:</strong> An adequate supply of drinking water must be provided, together with suitable cups, etc., unless the supply is from a drinking fountain. There should also be facilities for washing cups, or alternatively, disposable cups should be provided.</p><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Accommodation for clothing and changing</strong>: Suitable and sufficient accommodation must be provided for any special work clothing and for personal clothing, which is not worn at work. Clothing should be able to be hung in a clean, warm, dry and well-ventilated place, with at least a separate hook, peg or hanger for each worker. Where workers are required to wear special work clothing, adequate room for changing should be provided and measures should be taken to ensure security, for example by providing lockers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Facilities for rest and meals:</strong> Other than in offices, or similar clean workplaces, separate rest areas or, in new workplaces, separate rest rooms, should be provided. Suitable and sufficient facilities for eating meals should be provided where workers regularly eat meals at work. Minimum facilities should include a means of preparing or obtaining a hot drink and, where necessary, means of heating food.</p></div>';
