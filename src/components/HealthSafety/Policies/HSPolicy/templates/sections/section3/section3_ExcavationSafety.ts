export const SECTION3_EXCAVATION_SAFETY_TEMPLATE = '<div class="con"><p style="text-align: justify;">Excavations can impose risks not only to persons working in an excavation, but also to persons nearby, for example: other site workers, plant operators, site traffic, general public, road traffic etc. All excavations should be clearly highlighted. Red and white bunting/tape should be erected at a safe distance from the excavation edges and ‘Danger – Excavations’ signs should be displayed. Where there could be a risk to the general public, i.e., children, secure fencing/hoarding must be erected around the excavations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Supports:</b> All excavation sides must be adequately supported or the sides of the excavation battered to a safe angle. The type of supports and method of support will vary depending on the ground condition, nature of work to be carried out in and around the excavation and the environmental conditions etc. Whatever system of support adopted for an excavation, must provide adequate protection preventing the sides of an excavation giving way. When battering, the sides of an excavation must be cut back to a safe angle so that it would not be possible for the excavation sides to give way. All support materials must be checked to ensure they are adequate and in good condition.<br></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Guard-rails for excavations:</b> Guard-rails are required to be erected wherever it is possible for someone to fall into an excavation. The height of the top guard-rail should not be less than 950 mm above any edge from which persons are liable to fall. An intermediate guard-rail or other substantial barriers should be fitted between the top guard-rail and the toe boards, the vertical gaps should not exceed 470 mm. The guard-rail should be rigid enough not to give way should someone fall or lean against them. Guard-rails can only be removed from where it could be possible for someone to fall, if the guard-rails themselves become an unsafe obstruction or if it is reasonably not practicable to carry out the works with the guard-rails in place. In these cases, other forms of protecting persons from falling will have to be employed.<br></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Toe boards for excavations:</b> Toe boards are required at the top edges of excavations where it could be possible for materials/equipment to fall into the excavations putting persons working in the trench at risk. The height of the toe boards must be at least 150 mm above the ground level without gaps between them, then the supports would act as sufficient toe boarding.<br></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Spoil heaps:</b> Must be kept at a safe distance from the edges of excavations so that spoil heaps do not impose additional loading on the excavation sides and so that unobstructed safe access can be maintained on all sides of excavations.<br></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Inspections of excavations:</b> A competent person who fully understands the dangers and necessary precautions, should inspect the excavations at the start of each shift. Excavations should also be inspected after any event that may have affected their strength or stability, or after a fall of rock or earth. In addition, excavations that remain open for more than seven days should be inspected weekly. Any faults found should be rectified immediately. A record should be kept of all inspections.<br></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Underground Services Precautions:</b> Ensure that all appropriate Service Drawings where works are to be carried out are carefully inspected and any queries should be discussed with the appropriate Services, i.e., Gas Board, Electric Company, Water Company, Company Safety Offices, etc.<br></p><p style="text-align: justify;">All known underground services in the vicinity of the works should be trial holed in advance of the works and clearly marked up. This work should be a hand dig operation, hand tools only. Plant and Mechanical tools must not be used under any circumstances. Only experienced and competent Personnel should carry out this work.<br></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The line of the excavation works should always be checked before the excavation works are carried out for underground services:<br></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Using an underground cable detector, i.e., CAT<br></li><li style="text-align: justify;">Viewing of work surfaces, i.e., roads, pavements and fields, etc., where excavation works and laying of services may have been carried out before. Look for differences in tarmac, paving slabs and top soil/plant growth etc.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Check the lines and locations of services access covers</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Take note of the development history of the area of works and if necessary, check them out</li><li style="text-align: justify;">No mechanical plant or power tools should be used to excavate excavations within 1 metre of underground services</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Underground services should be adequately protected from possible damage i.e.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">When laying the pipes in position<br></li><li style="text-align: justify;">When lifting/lowering support boxes</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Adequately supporting services, which are exposed by excavations etc.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">All personnel on site should be made aware of underground services where they could be a potential hazard to them.</p></div>';
