They will draw on the experience of ‘users’ and be recorded against an ergonomic checklist based on the schedule to the Regulations.  Assessments will be reviewed periodically.</p>	<p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Information and Training:</strong> Employees shall receive the appropriate level of training in relation to DSE, including suitability of equipment, workstation layout, signs and symptoms of fatigue and pain resulting from DSE and early intervention measures to solve potential problems.</p><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Eyesight tests:</strong> We will provide eyesight test to employees who are ‘users’ if they request the. This means a “sight test” as defined in the Opticians Act and includes a test of vision and an examination of the eye completed by a registered ophthalmic optician (optometrist) or a registered medical practitioner. </p>	<p style="text-align: justify;">If the sight tests indicate that a ‘user’ needs ‘special corrective appliances’ (spectacles), as distinct from their normal spectacles, to overcome vision defects at the specific viewing distances they will be provided free of charge.  However, we are only obliged to provide basic spectacles, which are adequate for the purpose.  If users choose more expensive spectacles, they must pay the difference in cost between the basic ones and those of their choice.  If a user’s normal corrective spectacles are adequate for safe use at their DSE, the employer is not responsible for the provision of additional spectacles.</p></div>';
