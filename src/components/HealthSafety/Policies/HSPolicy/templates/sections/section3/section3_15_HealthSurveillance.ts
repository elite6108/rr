export const SECTION3_15_HEALTH_SURVEILLANCE_TEMPLATE = '<div class="con" style="display: block;"><p style="text-align: justify; ">Health surveillance is about systematically watching out for early signs of work- related ill health in employees exposed to certain health risks. It means putting in place certain procedures to achieve this. These procedures may include:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Simple methods, such as looking for skin damage on hands from using certain chemicals</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Technical checks on employees, such as hearing tests</li><li style="text-align: justify;">More involved medical examinations</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Some health and safety regulations also require us to provide health surveillance for employees.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We recognise our duty to make arrangements for health protection and surveillance and employees are required to co-operate. There may be requirements for health surveillance to continue even after cessation of the exposure, but this is for diseases that have a long latency period (such as asbestos-related disease).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is our policy to:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Carry out risk assessments under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations and any other applicable Regulations in order to decide if health surveillance is appropriate</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Place affected employees under suitable health surveillance where the risk assessment(s) indicate that health surveillance is appropriate</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Consult with employees and, where applicable safety representatives, over the proposed arrangements for health surveillance and for the need for affected employees to participate in these arrangements</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Inform affected employees, and where applicable safety representatives, of the health risks and of the health surveillance procedure</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Ensure that the person carrying out the health surveillance procedure is competent to undertake the task</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Ensure that the results of health surveillance are suitably recorded and that the records are kept readily available for inspection by any person who has a right to see them</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Suitably action any recommendations made as result of health surveillance and if necessary review the associated risk assessment</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Treat an individual\'s health surveillance records as confidential information</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Inform employees, and where applicable safety representatives, of the collective results of health surveillance, but ensuring that no individual is identified</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Ensuring that health surveillance records are retained for statutory retention periods</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Noise</strong>: The Noise at Work Regulations 2005 will be complied with. Noise assessments will be carried out as appropriate and action taken as identified necessary. First priority should be to reduce noise levels and exposure to noise. Hearing protection should be used where other means of controlling noise has failed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We will assess noise levels, reduce noise and exposure to noise and provide employees with information about the risk of noise, their responsibilities and how to obtain and look after ear protectors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where noise levels are such as to expose operatives to in excess of 80db(A) averaged over a working day, assessments will identify those operatives and/or activities that will require the provision of suitable noise reduction techniques and/or the use of ear defenders. Such assessments may be specific to site or related to the work activity. Operatives will ensure that the precautions suggested are implemented.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where noise levels exceed 85dB(A) areas affected will be established, signed and protected against unauthorised entry. Ear protection is necessary to prevent damage to hearing. The two main types of hearing protection are disposable or re-usable ear plugs and ear muffs. Ear protection shall be provided and worn by all within the noise affected area. Employees will be provided with information on hazards of work exposing them to noise levels in excess of 85dB(A) over a working day, instructed and trained in working methods to protect their hearing, including the use of ear defenders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Exposure to noise may cause:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Hearing loss</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Irritation, annoyance and fatigue</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Inefficiency and lack of concentration</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Failure to hear warnings, sounds and instructions</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Safeguard your hearing:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Use hearing protection as instructed</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Trained persons should supply and fit ear protection to suit individuals needs</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Keep ear protection clean, check regularly for damage</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Replace as necessary</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">A self-assessment questionnaire will be issued and completed by each operative at least annually. Any symptoms or signs of hearing impairment should be brought to the attention of management. Specialist advice will be sought from an occupational health professional as necessary.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dermatitis/Eczema</strong>: Contact dermatitis is inflammation of the skin caused by contact with a range of materials. The main signs of eczema are redness, swelling, crusting and cracking and flaking of your skin. These include detergents, toiletries, chemicals and even natural products like foods and water (if contact is prolonged or frequent). It can affect all parts of the body, but it is most common to see the hands affected.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are two main types of contact dermatitis:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Irritant contact dermatitis</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Allergic contact dermatitis</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Irritant contact dermatitis is caused by things that dry out and damage the skin, e.g. detergents, solvents, oils and prolonged or frequent contact with water.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Allergic contact dermatitis occurs when someone becomes allergic to something that comes into contact with his or her skin. The allergic reaction can show up hours or days after contact. Common causes include chemicals in cement, epoxy resins and some foods.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The signs and symptoms of the different types of dermatitis are similar. Dry, red and itchy skin is usually the first sign. Swelling, flaking, blistering, cracking and pain can follow.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes the consequences of contact with a material are immediately visible. Sometimes contact occurs without apparent effect. However, every contact can cause minute amounts of ‘invisible’ damage to the skin that can build up until more serious signs are seen.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our procedure is:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Avoid contact with materials that cause dermatitis. Adequate Information, instruction, training and supervision will be provided</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Protect the skin. Select suitable hand protection (barrier creams), suitable welfare facilities and appropriate PPE</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Check for early signs of dermatitis. A self- assessment questionnaire will be issued and completed by each operative at least annually. Any symptoms or signs of dermatitis / eczema should be brought to the attention of management</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Specialist advice will be sought from an occupational health professional as necessary</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Respiratory Disorders:&nbsp;</strong>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a long-term illness that makes breathing difficult. The lungs and breathing tubes are damaged making it difficult to get air in and out.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Common symptoms include:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">a persistent chesty cough and phlegm</li><li style="text-align: justify;">wheeze</li><li style="text-align: justify;">more frequent and troublesome chest infections</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">COPD is a slow developing condition; the symptoms tend only to start becoming a problem in mid-life, usually in the late forties onwards. A wide variety of dust or fume have the potential to cause COPD if exposure is high and over a long period of time, for example studies suggest the following substances have the potential to cause COPD:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Hardwood dust</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mineral dust</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Silica dust</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Solvent fumes in paint</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Welding Fumes</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Some of these occupations and substances are also linked to other diseases, for example, welding fume can cause fume fever and pneumonia. Some can also cause occupational asthma.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Occupational Asthma</strong>: Breathing in substances called respiratory sensitisers at work can cause occupational asthma. A respiratory sensitiser is a substance which when breathed in can trigger an irreversible allergic reaction in the respiratory system. Once this sensitisation reaction has taken place, further exposure to the substance, even to the tiniest trace, will produce symptoms. Sensitisation does not usually take place right away. It generally happens after several months or even years of breathing in the sensitiser.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The symptoms are:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Asthma - attacks of coughing, wheezing and chest tightness</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Rhinitis and conjunctivitis - runny or stuffy nose and watery or prickly eyes</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Once a person is sensitised, continued exposure can result in permanent damage to their lungs and increasingly severe symptoms. People with rhinitis may go on to develop asthma. Asthma attacks are likely to become worse and can be triggered by other things such as tobacco smoke, general air pollution or even cold air.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Respiratory sensitisers are subject to the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations (COSHH). COSHH requires the substitution of harmful products with less harmful ones. If this is not possible then you must use adequate control measures.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Many substances and processes used in the workplace create dust and fumes. All dusts and fumes are a risk to health.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our procedure is:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Avoid long term contact with machinery or tasks that would cause COPD/Asthma</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Adequate Information, instruction, training and supervision will be provided</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Suitable dust suppression should be provided with the machinery</li><li style="text-align: justify;">If you have any doubts about the substances or material you are to use, speak to your supervisor</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Checks should include the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Identify material or substances before use</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Read any information on packaging or containers or manufacturer’s instructions</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Make sure you have been trained in the use of the equipment</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Clean and service all equipment after use following maintenance instructions</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Select suitable equipment with dust suppression measures, and appropriate PPE as the last resort. When it is not possible to reduce the risk at source, respiratory equipment can safeguard health. It is available as:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Disposable face masks</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Half mask respirators and full-face respirators</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Positive pressure powered respirators</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Select the correct type of respiratory equipment</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Use additional protection, such as gloves, goggles and overalls as necessary</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Other equipment is designed for specialist work, e.g. in sewers</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vibration:</strong> Whole body vibration is transmitted through the seat or feet (known as whole-body vibration or WBV). Drivers of some mobile machines, including certain tractors, fork lift trucks and quarrying or earth-moving machinery, may be exposed to WBV and shocks, which are associated with back pain. Other work factors, such as posture and heavy lifting, are also known to contribute to back problems for drivers, however further study is needed into the impact of WBV.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hand-Arm Vibration</strong> is vibration transmitted from work processes into workers\' hands and arms. It can be caused by operating hand-held power tools, such as road breakers, and hand-guided equipment, such as powered lawnmowers, or by holding materials being processed by machines, such as pedestal grinders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Regular and frequent exposure to hand-arm vibration can lead to permanent health effects. This is most likely when contact with a vibrating tool or work process is a regular part of a person’s job. Occasional exposure is unlikely to cause ill health. Hand-arm vibration can cause a range of conditions collectively known as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS), as well as specific diseases such as carpal tunnel syndrome.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our procedure is:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Avoid long term contact with machinery that would cause HAVS. Adequate Information, instruction, training and supervision will be provided</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Select suitable vibration dampened equipment, suitable welfare facilities (warmth) and appropriate PPE as the last resort.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Check for early signs of HAVS. A self- assessment questionnaire will be issued and completed by each operative at least annually. Any symptoms or signs of HAVS/ white finger should be brought to the attention of management. Specialist advice will be sought from an occupational health professional as necessary.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Management of Stress:</strong> The company acknowledges that stress in the workplace can affect staff at all levels and can be caused by:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Job content</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Working environment</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Relationship with others at work</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Excessive workload or working hours</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Inadequate training</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Personal problems outside the workplace</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify; ">We will provide mechanisms designed to discover and manage instances of stress and promote a return to full health as soon as possible.</p></div>';
