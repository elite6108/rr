This will include as a minimum all of our work sites and projects.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Such assessments will be held at places where the risk is likely to be encountered and measures will be taken by this Company to ensure that the assessment findings and precautionary measures to be taken are communicated to persons at risk to which the assessment refers.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">All risk assessments compiled will be subject to review if the designated person suspects that the assessment is no longer valid, or if there has been a significant change in the matters to which the assessment relates. This will include times where projects progress as the programme develops.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where it is assessed the risk of an activity is high and remains high following the implementation of control measures and specialist guidance, alternative methods of working will be adopted.</p></div>';
