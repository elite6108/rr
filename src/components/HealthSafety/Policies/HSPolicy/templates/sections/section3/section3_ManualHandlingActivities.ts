export const SECTION3_MANUAL_HANDLING_ACTIVITIES_TEMPLATE = '<div class="con"><p style="text-align: justify;">In carrying out a manual handling risk assessment, consideration will be given to the requirements of the Manual Handling Operation Regulations 1992.  Under these Regulations we have a duty to prevent employees from handling loads that are likely to cause injury.  This injury may be due to the weight of the load, but it is not sufficient just to think of manual handling hazards only as a function of weight.  Other factors should be considered such as:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The physical size of the load</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The provision of carrying handles or lifting straps</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The position of the centre of gravity within the load</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Is the load rigid or will the load move? i.e. partially filled fluid containers</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Is the load inert or is it a person?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Where is it being moved from, and to where?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">If the load is being moved outside, consider weather conditions</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Consider the ground conditions over which the load has to be moved</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the physical aspects of the load and the area in which it has to be moved, we must also consider the physical attributes of the person actually doing the lifting and carrying.  Every employee is an individual and employers must also consider this when assessing manual handling tasks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The first step in carrying out the assessment is to eliminate the need to manually handle loads if this is possible.  This means introducing mechanical ways of lifting and moving loads whenever practicable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A generic assessment may be undertaken, and the assessment applied across different premises or sites.  However, in a construction the working environment of the workplace is continually changing and so the site managers and every employee must continuously be looking for, and assessing site operations that involve manual handling operations, and produce a site-specific assessment for moving heavy or awkward loads.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Employees are to be encouraged to highlight activities which involve manual handling operations which are likely to cause injury.  In planning, managers will try to minimise the requirements for manual handling and ongoing training will be provided to employees to enable them to carry out their own assessments of the load before undertaking manual handling tasks and to enable them to lift using kinetic handling techniques.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In construction operations, there are a lot of manual handling issues, but items that must be considered at planning stage (with a view to eliminating the need for manual handling) are:</p><p></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The maximum weight to be lifted by one person should be 25 kg</li><li style="text-align: justify;">If the lifting is of a repetitive nature, this should be reduced to 20 kg</li></ul><p></p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Heavy blocks must be assessed to see if there are alternatives.  If not then smaller unit sizes must be considered so there is a corresponding reduction in weight.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Heavy kerbs typically weigh 67 kg and are too heavy even for 2 people.  Therefore they should be only handled by mechanical means.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Masonry features such as plinths, lintels, arched lintels etc will likely require a mechanical lift to get them into position.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Difficult or cumbersome items such as plasterboard should be assessed and selected according to practical needs and health &amp; safety.  Boards 900mm wide are readily available and these are obviously easier and safer to handle that boards of 1200mm wide, especially if being fixed to ceiling joists, when the full weight of the board has to be sustained until fixed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Heavy kerb stones should be questioned.  Development work is progressing to try and design kerbs which are lighter, but when in position have the same properties as traditional kerbs.  Until these items are available, traditional kerbs must be handled by mechanical means. </p><p style="text-align: justify; ">For new construction work mechanical means of lifting must be used.  For short duration repair work, 2 man lifting frames can be considered but the kerbs should still be positioned as close to the working place as possible using mechanical means with the manual lift frame being used only for the final positioning.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Other items requiring special consideration include:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Gas boilers and gas fires</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Large timber units such as stairs or kitchen units and worktops</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Large items such as double-glazed units, patio doors, security doors, garage doors etc.</li></ul><p></p><p style="text-align: justify; ">These items should have been identified at the design stage and have been dealt with by the Designer and / or Principal Designer.  However, as the Contractor or Principal Contractor it is equally important that we check and ensure we have the necessary assessments in place to ensure excessive weights or repetitive handling likely to cause injury does not occur.</p></div>';
