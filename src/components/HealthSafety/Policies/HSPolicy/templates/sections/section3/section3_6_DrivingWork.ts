Employees should be aware that even though the use of fixed hands-free kits is not illegal, there is still a possibility of prosecution if a law enforcement officer believes that they were not in full control of the vehicle. For this reason, usage should be kept to a minimum whilst driving.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Any use of a hand-held mobile device is strictly prohibited whilst the car engine is switched on.
