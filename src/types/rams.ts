  ORDER_OF_WORKS_TASK: 'groundworks' as const,
  DELIVERY_INFO: `1.	Weight of the stone materials approx. 32K per SQM. Weight of kitchen cabinet units will vary. 
2.	Materials will be loaded onto vans at our fabrication centre. Materials will be strapped onto metal frames or secured by other means within the van to prevent movement and damage.
3.	Our fitting/installation team that is driving will do as safe as possible (see risk assessment for more information).
4.	The driver will park at the pre-arranged designated location or if not disclosed, then the driver will park as close to the building and safe as possible
5.	The driver will contact site managers if the designated parking location is difficult to park, or park in the loading bays provided.
6.	The driver will exit the van and inspect that the van is not parked on any pathways, pedestrian walkways, curbs, grass, single or double yellow lines or any on any area that is required by highway standard to keep free. The van will be will not block or hinder roads or emergency exits
7.	Upon existing the van if required, cones will be placed around the rea to ensure that no vehicle parks behind and for passers-by not to walk behind the van
8.	Before unloading the materials, our team will contact site staff to sign in and obtain their induction
9.	On return to the van, they will: 
a.	Inspect the pathway to the installation area ensuring that the pathway is clear from any object or hazards. If items need to be removed site staff will be informed
b.	Asses the installation is area is also free from any clutter, objects or hazard and report and move any if found
10.	When unloading they will undo the straps that are keeping the material in place on the van. They will undo one bar clamp/strap at a time
11.	They will bring the loading trolley to the rear of the vehicle
12.	They will slide out the material from the frame on to the trolley. Manual handling may be required depending on level of the floor, trolley height, and to guide the material onto the trolley. Hand clamps are to be used to assist grip of material. Gloves to be worn during this step
13.	They will then stroll the trolley into the installation area and keeping an eye on hazards that approach
14.	If the floor level of works is above ground floor, then the stone masons will use the loading bays and commercial delivery elevators to transport above ground
15.	Should there not be any lifts, then the team may use the standard elevators if possible
16.	Where elevators are to be used, the team will calculate given the material weight of 32K PSQM is under the limit of the elevator. Standard low-rise buildings should be capable of 907KG -1134KG
17.	Communication between the team is vital ensuring that all know the hazards that are identified
18.	Once at the installation area the trolley will be parked as close to the unit as possible allowing our team to slide the material onto the unit
19.	They will return to the van to repeat this process whilst checking for any new and additional hazards approach
20.	Once all materials are in place, they will take the trolley back to the van so not to cause a hazard and will then fetch their tools and equipment.`,
  GROUNDWORKS_INFO: `
TEMPLATING:
Site Assessment:
•	Ensure the space is clear and the kitchen cabinets are correctly positioned and secure.
•	Verify that the area is level and free of obstructions that could affect measurements.
•	Discuss any site-specific details with the client, such as specific requirements for sink cutouts, hob placements, or any bespoke features.
Proliner Setup:
•	Ensure that the Proliner digital measuring pen is fully charged and calibrated. Verify that it's working correctly by performing a test measure on a known flat surface.
•	Prepare backup batteries and storage devices (e.g., USB or cloud storage) for saving the measurements.
Initial Marking of Key Points:
•	Using the Proliner, mark the key reference points on the edges of the worktop areas. This includes the corners, sink, hob, and any unusual features such as curved edges or islands.
•	If applicable, use a laser level or another reference point to ensure all key measurements are in line with the installation specifications.
Taking Measurements:
•	Begin the digital measuring process by moving the Proliner pen across the surface of the cabinets, recording the dimensions at multiple points. This process is precise and should account for any variations in the surfaces or walls that may not be perfectly straight.
•	For irregularities, the Proliner will automatically capture those measurements, allowing for easy adjustments in the final template.
Recording Cutouts & Details:
•	Accurately record measurements for any required cutouts (e.g., sink, taps, hobs, drainage areas). Ensure these are marked according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
•	If the worktop will need to accommodate plumbing, wiring, or other fixtures, these measurements should be recorded in detail.
Verification of Measurements (office staff):
•	Double-check measurements with the site contact to ensure everything is correct before proceeding.
•	Make sure that all dimensions are captured, and discuss any potential adjustments required (e.g., if there are discrepancies in wall angles or fitting issues). 
Generating the Digital Template (CAD staff:
•	Once all key measurements are taken, generate a digital template using the Proliner software.
•	Export and save the digital file in the required format for manufacturing. If necessary, email or upload the template to the production team.
Double-Check the Template:
•	Cross-reference the digital template with the physical space to ensure all measurements are accurate.
•	Make any required adjustments before finalizing the template for production.

  
INSTALLTING WORKTOPS:
1.	Templators will measure the worktop area in the designated installation area. They will report back with photos and access requirements to relay on to our team who will return to install the worktops. They will use equipment to measure the surface areas.
2.	It is essential to dry fit the pieces before any adhesives are applied to ensure all levels are correct and that all pieces fit accurately.
3.	Our stone masons will slide the material into place by hand to ensure that the correct joints and overhang measurement is achieved. 
4.	Pieces / Joints will be checked for level accuracy. If the floor or unit is not level site manager will be notified before installation and sealing. Packers may be used to adjust the worktop level from the base unit. 
5.	Once the materials are in position the team will use the seam setter to mechanically bring the joints closer. This step requires the use of masks and gloves as mentioned above due to the epoxy resin that is applied to the joints. Seam Setter to be removed and excess resin to be wiped. 
6.	Any small upstands to be applied will have silicone stuck to the back of the material ready to be placed – gloves and mask to be required during this step.
7.	If required, upstands may need to be trimmed on site. It is essential before this is done to check the surrounding area to ensure that people are not walking in the direction of any airborne dust that is a result of any trimming or grinding or polishing. Such actions should be done outside and all cables for such tools to be taped to the floor to avoid any trips. Cones to place around the area to prevent people walking by.
8.	Apply silicone to the underside of the material to seal between worktop and unit – gloves and mask to be required during this step.
