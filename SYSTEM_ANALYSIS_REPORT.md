#### AI Hazard Identification Assistant
Located in `AIHazardHelper.tsx`, this feature provides intelligent hazard identification with automatic risk scoring:

**Functionality**:
- Identifies potential workplace hazards based on task details
- Automatically calculates risk scores using likelihood × severity formula
- Provides comprehensive hazard analysis with control measures
- Supports both before and after control measure risk calculations

**Risk Calculation System**:
The AI uses a sophisticated risk scoring system based on industry-standard risk assessment methodology:

1. **Likelihood Rating** (1-9 scale):
   - 1 = Very unlikely to occur
   - 3 = Unlikely but possible
   - 5 = Moderate likelihood
   - 7 = Likely to occur
   - 9 = Almost certain to occur

2. **Severity Rating** (1-9 scale):
   - 1 = Minor injury (first aid only)
   - 3 = Minor injury requiring medical attention
   - 5 = Moderate injury (lost time)
   - 7 = Serious injury or long-term health effect
   - 9 = Fatal or life-changing injury

3. **Risk Score Calculation**:
   ```
   Risk Score = Likelihood × Severity
   ```
   - Low Risk: 1-20
   - Medium Risk: 21-40
   - High Risk: 41-60
   - Very High Risk: 61-81

**AI-Generated Hazard Components**:
For each identified hazard, the AI provides:
1. **Hazard Title**: Clear, specific hazard identification
2. **Who Might Be Harmed**: Specific groups at risk (e.g., "cleaners", "maintenance workers")
3. **How They Might Be Harmed**: Detailed injury scenarios (e.g., "slip on wet floor resulting in broken bones")
4. **Initial Risk Assessment**:
   - Before control measures likelihood (1-5 in current implementation, scales to 1-9)
   - Before control measures severity (1-5 in current implementation, scales to 1-9)
   - Calculated risk score
5. **Control Measures**: Specific actions to reduce risk
6. **Residual Risk Assessment**:
   - After control measures likelihood (typically reduced)
   - After control measures severity (often remains the same)
   - New calculated risk score

**Example Risk Calculation**:
```
Hazard: "Wet floor in cleaning area"
Who: "Cleaners and other staff"
How: "Slip on wet floor causing fractures or head injury"

Before Control Measures:
- Likelihood: 6 (happens sometimes)
- Severity: 7 (serious injury possible)
- Risk Score: 42 (High Risk)

Control Measures:
- Use wet floor warning signs
- Implement cleaning schedule during low-traffic times
- Provide non-slip footwear
- Use quick-drying cleaning products

After Control Measures:
- Likelihood: 2 (unlikely with controls)
- Severity: 7 (injury severity unchanged)
- Risk Score: 14 (Low Risk)
```

**Implementation Details**:
- The AI analyzes task context, location, PPE, and working methods
- Generates realistic hazard scenarios based on industry knowledge
- Automatically assigns appropriate likelihood and severity ratings
- Provides practical, implementable control measures
- Calculates both initial and residual risk scores

#### AI Security and Privacy
- API keys stored securely in environment variables
- No sensitive data stored in AI requests
